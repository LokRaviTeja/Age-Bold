This project implements a configuration-driven PySpark pipeline to ingest healthcare
eligibility files from multiple partners with different formats.
Partner-specific settings such as delimiter, column mapping, and date format are defined
in configuration. The core processing logic remains unchanged when adding new partners.
The pipeline outputs a unified, standardized dataset suitable for downstream analytics.
